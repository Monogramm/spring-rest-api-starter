Some key notes before you open a MR:

 2. MR name follows [convention](http://karma-runner.github.io/4.0/dev/git-commit-msg.html)
 3. All tests pass locally, UI and Unit tests
 4. All business logic and validations must be on the server-side
 5. Update necessary Documentation
 6. Put `:gitmoji: TG-XXX #done` in your comment to auto-close the issue that your MR fixes (or `:gitmoji: closes #XXXX` if using GitLab issues)
